//! Composed USD stage.
//!
//! A [`Stage`] loads a root layer file and all its dependencies, then provides
//! composed access to the scene graph by merging opinions across layers
//! according to USD's [LIVERPS] strength ordering:
//!
//! 1. **L**ocal opinions (root layer stack / sublayers) — strongest
//! 2. **I**nherit arcs
//! 3. **V**ariant set arcs
//! 4. **R**eference arcs
//! 5. **P**ayload arcs
//! 6. **S**pecialize arcs — weakest
//!
//! The strength ordering applies recursively within each composition context.
//! When building prim and property stacks:
//!
//! - Local opinions are evaluated first
//! - Inherit arcs follow
//! - Variant sets are applied next
//! - References are processed
//! - Payloads are composed
//! - Specialize arcs provide fallback values
//!
//! # Configuration
//!
//! Use [`StageBuilder`] to customize stage behavior before opening:
//!
//! - [`StageBuilder::resolver`] sets a custom
//!   [`ar::Resolver`](crate::ar::Resolver) for mapping asset paths to files.
//! - [`StageBuilder::variant_fallbacks`] provides a
//!   [`VariantFallbackMap`](crate::pcp::VariantFallbackMap) with preferred
//!   selections for variant sets that have no authored opinion.
//! - [`StageBuilder::load`] controls whether payload arcs are
//!   loaded during stage population.
//! - [`StageBuilder::mask`] limits the prim working set exposed by
//!   stage queries and traversal.
